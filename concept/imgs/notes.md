A town accelerates, calmy integrative & edified.

City, Infrastructure, and Ecology as the narrative for growth. Building communities like a software app for the new-age: youth, elders, urban-migrants, nomads and new immigration. Canada has a host of land and opportunities for people of the globe to move. Can we think about cities not in narratives, but in beauty and aesthetics. With stimulus, activating investment in parks and gardens, with recyclable and updating homes.

Recent pandemic times have created a rapid acceleration of cooperative activity showcasing each countries ability to update our supply chain, adapt products, create new flows of people, and adapt to new norms via ways of accommodation.

Cities that resemble software, components that work together in integrative pieces, whereby more nomadic & folk-like like individuals might want to play, interact, enjoy, and build. Something that represents a type of global subscription model via hubs and collectives for future travel.

A woven knit of multiculturalism, not just by nationality, but aesthetic culture that builds through time dynamically, with sustainability and solarpunk at its core.

Digital citizens that can move between collectives across the global, experimenting with the narratives, working for global service agencies, and contributing to new global economies. In an automatic society, the attraction of ‘where’ one lives, gets replaced by who one becomes and meets through learning, progress, and growth.

Currently exploring various angles of: The Orbit (http://innisfilaccelerates.ca) or bio-integrative cities with new workings in bio-tech / medicines with a traditional combination, one that is resilient and sustaining.

Thinking about building new cities in a way that creates and assembles through a type of sorting hat type-model. Stemming these practices around a university / common learning hub, with spokes as communities. Perpetual cities where people learn, work, research, & live.

Reeducated into the Technical, Agriculture, Software Engineering, & Entrepreneurial.
